# Odd notes
## Markdown - VS Code vs Edge
VS Code can help with adding local hyperlinks to a document eg [Odd notes](#odd-notes).

However, in some cases the VS Code version (which works within a VS Code environment) does not work in MS Edge. Example - if there is a hyphen in the name.

VS Code version, does not work in Edge: [Markdown - VS Code vs Edge](#markdown---vs-code-vs-edge)
Edge version, does not work in VS Code: [Markdown - VS Code vs Edge](#markdown-vs-code-vs-edge)
