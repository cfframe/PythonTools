# Python Tools
More accurately, items I've coded and found I was using in multiple projects.  

Objectives include:
* some python practice, including coding tests
* maintain a master copy of items that can be re-used elsewhere, with main testing covered
in a single place (this repo)

Coded with python 3.8.10 in PyCharm.

## PyCharm set up (optional)
Create a virtual environment that uses python 3.8 (or your fave flavour).

Open a new Terminal window within PyCharm, verify it's using the new virtual environment. May need to manually do this eg:

```commandline
venv/scripts/activate.ps1
```

Install modules from the requirements file:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
